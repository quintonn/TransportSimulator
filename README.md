# TransportSimulator
The aim of this project is to eventually create a javascript/HTML5 game similar to transport tycoon.

But before even starting game development, some other tasks need to be completed:
1. Decide which game framework/engine to use.
   Some options so far include:.
    1. [Kiwi JS](http://www.kiwijs.org/)
    2. [pixi JS](http://www.pixijs.com/)
    3. [Crafty JS](http://craftyjs.com/)
    4. [Phaser IO](http://phaser.io/)
2. TODO: more things here.
