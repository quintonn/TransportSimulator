# TransportSimulator
The aim of this project is to eventually create a javascript/HTML5 game similar to transport tycoon.

One of the goals is to create maps, game artifacts etc that get generated dynamically. I.E. no pre-designed maps or images.

Roads, for example, could be created using svg's using paths. Some preliminary testing showed that performance with svg is pretty good.

But before even starting game development, some other tasks need to be completed:

 1. Decide which game framework/engine to use. Some options so far include         
	  1. [Kiwi JS](http://www.kiwijs.org/)
	  2. [pixi JS](http://www.pixijs.com/) 
	  3. [Crafty JS](http://craftyjs.com/) 
	  4. [Phaser IO](http://phaser.io/)
  
2. TODO: more things here.
