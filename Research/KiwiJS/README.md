# Findings #

## Pros ##
1.	Seems to have a pretty good maths library for getting angles and calculating transformations etc.
2.	Easy to add sprite sheets and to animate objects.
3.	Doesn't seem like a very stable library/framework.

## Cons ##
1.	Documentation is a bit difficult to navigate and sort of out of date.
2.	Seems tricky to just draw things dynamically. Have to use lines and polygons.
	- This will be to add things like roads and paths in general.
