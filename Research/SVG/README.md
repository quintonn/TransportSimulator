# SVG Research

The files in this folder contain my preliminary SVG tests.
What I managed to do was to create a fixed path and then clone it to perform various formatting and styling to it to display a road with lines in the middle.

This same technique can be used to add the yellow shoulder lines on the road etc etc.

Something else to be tested is to see if a SVG path can be created by the user by click, drag and release.
